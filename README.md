# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# To do list

- Fill out the home page
- Laucnh on firebase
- Add final finishing css touches to make it look good

- Add the api keys into env
- Fix bug with chart overflowing
- Add login
- Add stripe
- Add a better looking contact form
- Add a course link so users can buy your course
- Use flex grow to push the principle so that it looks nicer with the currency
